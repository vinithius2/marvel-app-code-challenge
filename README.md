# How to run?

The project is simple to run, just let Gradle work and then run the project.

# About the project

The project uses MVVM in its architecture, coded 100% in Kotlin and uses some libraries such as Navigation, Coroutines, Koin, Retrofit, Paging 3 and among other important libraries.

# Difficulties:

Particularly it was my first time using the Paging 3 library, which took me a long time in the project, as I had to study and apply the new library, this did not allow me to add more functions to the project.
